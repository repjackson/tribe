        quote
            Now as a man is like this or like that,
            according as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he be;
            a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad;
            he becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds;
            
            And here they say that a person consists of desires,
            and as is his desire, so is his will;
            and as is his will, so is his deed;
            and whatever deed he does, that he will reap.
            
            — Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, 7th Century BCE
